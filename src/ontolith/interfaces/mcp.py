"""MCP server for Ontolith (ADR-0008, ADR-0014).

Exposes read/propose/flag tools to AI agents. No direct write tool is exposed;
every *assertion* mutation flows through the proposal/policy pipeline.
``ontolith.create_entity`` (KI-082) is the one exception to "every mutation
flows through propose": entity creation was never gated behind
proposal/policy at the SDK level either (an entity carries no fact/
confidence/temporality for a policy to evaluate — it's an identity anchor,
not an assertion), so this tool is propose-tier, same capability floor as
every other tool here, not a "direct write" in ADR-0008's sense.

Tools (ADR-0008, plus resubmit added for KI-027, retract added for KI-057/ADR-0039,
list_contradictions added for KI-076, create_entity added for KI-082):
  ontolith.schema           — read concept/relation definitions
  ontolith.get              — fetch entity + current assertions
  ontolith.create_entity    — create a new entity (propose-tier, not a direct write)
  ontolith.query            — symbolic entity retrieval
  ontolith.provenance       — full provenance trail for an assertion
  ontolith.list_contradictions — read-only contradiction listing
  ontolith.propose          — create a proposal (NOT write)
  ontolith.flag_contradiction — open/extend a contradiction for review
  ontolith.resubmit         — resubmit a changes_requested proposal (NOT write)
  ontolith.retract          — propose retraction of an assertion (NOT write)

Authentication (ADR-0014): every tool, reads included, resolves a bearer
token to a Principal via the injected AuthProvider — the acting principal is
always server-derived from a verified credential, never client-asserted. One
server (one AuthProvider/backend) can serve many principals, each with their
own issued token (``kb.issue_token(principal_id, author=admin_id)`` via
SDK/CLI — requires the issuing author to hold `admin` capability). Read
tools require no further capability check beyond a resolved principal:
capability is a total order (SPEC §8.3, ``read < propose < write < review <
admin``), so any successfully authenticated principal already clears the
"read" floor.

Token transport (KI-067): every tool still accepts an optional ``token``
argument, but under the SSE/streamable-HTTP transports the server prefers
an ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` HTTP header when the transport supplies
one, falling back to the argument only when no header is present at all.
Prefer the header: the argument must be emitted by the calling model as
part of the tool call itself, landing it in the model's own context window
and any MCP client's tool-call logging; the header travels on the transport
connection instead, out of the model's context entirely. A header that IS
present but malformed (wrong scheme, or a blank value) fails the call
closed rather than silently falling back to the argument — see
``_bearer_token``'s docstring for why. stdio has no HTTP request at all, so
``token`` remains the only channel there — ADR-0014 recommends short-lived
tokens for stdio-facing principals for that reason.

That fallback is opt-in to disable (KI-073): ``create_mcp_server(...,
require_header_token=True)`` makes an absent header fail the call the same
as no credential at all, even when a caller still supplies ``token`` —
letting an HTTP deployment require the more private channel outright
instead of merely preferring it. Off by default, since it makes stdio
transports (which have no header channel to require) unusable outright;
a deployment reaches for it once the header path is available, not
because the argument fallback is itself a live vulnerability.

Error handling (KI-059, KI-074, SPEC §16): every tool wraps its body in one
``except OntolithError as exc: return _error_response(exc)``, the MCP
equivalent of REST's single ``@app.exception_handler(OntolithError)`` and
GraphQL's single ``process_errors`` override — not a per-tool, per-exception-
type catch, which previously left some taxonomy members unreachable and let
the ``code`` values drift from REST/GraphQL's own. ``_error_response()``
returns ``{"error", "code", "detail"}`` for every taxonomy member, redacting
``StorageError``/``PluginError`` messages the same way those two interfaces
already do (they interpolate raw internal exception text).

Usage:
    from ontolith.identity.token_auth import TokenAuthProvider
    from ontolith.interfaces.mcp import create_mcp_server
    mcp = create_mcp_server(kb, TokenAuthProvider(kb.backend))
    mcp.run()          # stdio (default for MCP)
    mcp.run("sse")     # SSE transport

                argument is the fallback, and the only channel on stdio —
                unless the server was created with ``require_header_token=True``
                (KI-073), in which case this argument is never accepted and
                stdio becomes unusable.
            filters: Optional dict of property/relation name → value
                (equality) — a relation filter matches the relation's
                target entity id (e.g. {"employer": "org-123"}) — or
                property__op → value using a closed set of lookup-operator
                suffixes (KI-039): __contains (substring), __gt/__lt/__gte/
                __lte (numeric range, schema-declared Integer/Float
                properties only), e.g. {"age__gte": 18}. Multi-hop
                double-underscore keys (e.g. "employer__name") and any
                suffix outside this closed operator set are not supported
                and raise a validation_error (ADR-0027, KI-030).
            semantic: Optional query text — ranks results by vector
                similarity (SPEC §11.3) instead of/in addition to
                ``filters``. Requires the server's ``Ontology`` to have an
                ``Embedder`` configured; otherwise returns a
                validation_error.
            as_of: Optional ISO-8601 timestamp (SPEC §11.4) — reconstructs
                the knowledge base as it stood at that point in time
                instead of querying current state. The first of the four
                shipped interfaces to expose bitemporal time-travel at all
                (REST/GraphQL/CLI don't yet — KI-058's own scope is MCP
                only). A malformed value returns a validation_error.
                Combined with ``semantic``: only entity *existence* as of
                this time is reconstructed (an entity that didn't exist yet
                is excluded) — the ranking itself is not bitemporal, since
                the vector index holds one embedding per entity as of its
                last reindex, not a historical version. Results are always
                ranked by an entity's *current* embedded content.
            min_confidence: Optional 0.0-1.0 floor — keep only entities
                with at least one qualifying active assertion at or above
                this confidence (ADR-0004: an assertion with
                confidence=None never satisfies a numeric threshold).
            trust_at_least: Optional floor on a qualifying assertion's
                *effective* trust_level (min(author, acting_as) under
                delegation, KI-047) — independent of ``min_confidence``;
                the qualifying assertion need not be the same for both.
            limit: Optional cap on the number of entities returned.

        Returns:
            Dict with "entities" list and "count", or "error" if no token
            was resolvable, it does not resolve to a valid principal, a

        Mirrors REST's ``GET /contradictions`` and GraphQL's
        ``Query.contradictions`` (SPEC §14.1) — before this tool,
        ``ontolith.flag_contradiction`` (propose-tier: extends membership,
        flips assertion statuses to ``flagged``) was the only MCP surface
        that returned a contradiction at all, so an agent that only wanted
        to *read* one — including its accumulated ``rationale_history``,
        KI-071/KI-075 — had no way to do so without also performing a write
        (KI-076).

        Args:
            state: Filter by contradiction state ("open" or "resolved").

                both already document and accept, kept here too for
                cross-interface consistency even though MCP's JSON
                arguments could instead use an explicit ``null``
                unambiguously (unlike REST's HTTP query string, which
                can't express "no filter" any other way — see that route's
                own docstring). ``None``, passed explicitly, works

                punished for using it. Anything else — including a
                near-miss like ``"Open"``, ``"unresolved"``, or the
                literal string ``"None"`` a model might emit for a null —
                raises a validation_error rather than silently matching
                zero contradictions, which an agent could otherwise
                mistake for "no contradictions exist" (KI-076 review).
