"""GraphQL interface for Ontolith (SPEC §14.3, ADR-0037).

Exposes the ``Entity``, ``Assertion``, ``Proposal``, ``Contradiction``, and
``Principal`` types SPEC §14.3 names, with ``query``, ``propose``, and
``review`` operations "mirroring the SDK" (SPEC's own phrasing) — narrower
than the REST interface (``interfaces/rest.py``, ADR-0021/0022), which also
exposes a direct-write route and principal/token admin as REST-specific
extensions beyond SPEC parity (KI-022). This module deliberately does not
add GraphQL equivalents of those: no direct-write mutation, no principal
creation or token issuance/revocation. ``principals`` is exposed as a
read-only query only, since SPEC explicitly names ``Principal`` as one of
the five exposed types.

Authentication (ADR-0014, reused unchanged, same posture as REST/ADR-0021):
every query and mutation requires an ``Authorization: Bearer <token>``
header, resolved server-side via the injected ``AuthProvider`` — never a
caller-asserted principal ID. Unlike REST's ``Depends``-based dependency
(which raises before the route body runs), GraphQL has no single
request-level auth gate: auth resolution happens in ``context_getter``
(storing either the resolved ``Principal`` or the ``AuthError`` in context,
never raising there) and each field resolver calls
``_require_principal(info)`` first, which raises the stored ``AuthError``
if resolution failed — the exception then flows through GraphQL's normal
per-field error path into the response body, same as any other domain
error (see below). This deferred-to-resolver-time design exists so
introspection queries (``__schema``) *can* stay reachable without a token
when a deployment opts into that (``introspection=True`` — see
``create_graphql_app``'s own docstring; ``False`` by default since KI-056,
so this isn't the out-of-the-box behavior).

Error handling: GraphQL has no HTTP-status channel for domain errors the
way REST does (SPEC §16's ``code``/``message``/``detail`` envelope doesn't
map onto HTTP status codes here — by GraphQL convention, every response is
HTTP 200 and errors surface in the response body's ``errors[]`` array).
``_OntolithSchema.process_errors`` is the single centralized hook (mirrors
REST's one ``@app.exception_handler(OntolithError)`` instead of per-route
try/except): for every error whose ``original_error`` is an
``OntolithError``, it sets ``extensions = {"code": ..., "detail": ...}``;
``StorageError``/``PluginError`` (the same two REST maps to 5xx) additionally
get their message redacted to a generic string and the real message logged
server-side only — the raw text can carry internal exception detail (e.g.
sqlite3 constraint/transaction-state messages) a caller has no use for. Any
other resolver exception (not an ``OntolithError`` at all — a genuine bug)
is redacted the same way, with ``extensions.code = "INTERNAL_ERROR"``: REST's
equivalent path gets FastAPI's generic, code-less 500, never the raw
message, and this must fail closed to match rather than leak by omission.

Concurrency (KI-052): every resolver is ``async def``. ``_require_principal``/
``_kb`` are cheap dict lookups and run inline, but everything that touches
``kb``/``kb.backend`` — the actual blocking SQLite/DuckDB I/O — is factored
into a plain sync helper function and run via
``starlette.concurrency.run_in_threadpool``. Unlike REST, whose plain ``def``
routes Starlette dispatches to a thread pool automatically, `strawberry`'s
`GraphQLRouter` executes resolvers inline on the ASGI event loop by default;
without this, one slow resolver would block every concurrent request (not
just database-bound ones) for its full duration — measured directly during
review, closed here.

Usage:
    from ontolith.identity.token_auth import TokenAuthProvider
    from ontolith.interfaces.graphql import create_graphql_app
    app = create_graphql_app(kb, TokenAuthProvider(kb.backend))
    # uvicorn.run(app) to serve; GraphiQL served at /graphql by default, but
    # introspection is off by default (KI-056) so it can't load a schema —
    # pass introspection=True for a working interactive dev experience:
    # app = create_graphql_app(kb, TokenAuthProvider(kb.backend), introspection=True)

            queries are answered at all. False by default (KI-056):

            Leaving ``graphql_ide`` at its default while this is False still
            serves the IDE page itself (GET /graphql returns 200), but the

        docs_url: FastAPI Swagger UI path, or None to disable it. Kept for
            parity with ``create_rest_app`` — this app has no REST routes
            of its own, but mounting under a shared FastAPI app is a
            documented usage pattern, and the FastAPI docs surface exists
