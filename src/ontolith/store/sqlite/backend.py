        """Begin an explicit transaction (ADR-0010, KI-084).

        Acquires self._lock (KI-023) — held across every subsequent
        @_synchronized call until commit()/rollback() releases it, so no
        other thread's operation can interleave with this transaction.
        Only serializes *this process*'s own threads — see KI-084's
        `docs/adr/ADR-0001-storage-default.md` update for the
        cross-process constraint this alone doesn't cover.

        ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE``, not a plain deferred ``BEGIN`` (KI-084): a
        deferred transaction takes its read snapshot lazily, on first
        statement. `assert_literal`/`assert_ref`'s own conflict-routing
        read (SPEC §10) and `propose`/`propose_ref`'s auto-accept branch,
        `accept_proposal`, and `resubmit`'s auto-accept branch (via
        `_replay_proposal_operations`) all do that read *inside* the
        `transaction()` block this method opens — so a deferred `BEGIN`
        let a concurrent writer (a second OS process; `self._lock` above
        only protects this process's own threads) commit between that read
        and this connection's own later write. The resulting write then
        hit `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` — a stale-snapshot-upgrade failure
        SQLite deliberately never routes through the busy handler, so it
        failed immediately no matter how long `busy_timeout` (set in
        `__init__`) allowed. `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` claims the write lock right
        here, before any read this transaction goes on to do, so a
        concurrent writer is instead serialized behind it — blocked and
        retried by the busy handler, same as any other reachable
        `SQLITE_BUSY`, for up to `busy_timeout` before genuinely failing.

        This is not a blanket claim that every `Ontology` write is now
        cross-process-safe — see KI-084's `docs/known-issues.md` entry and
        its own KI-092 follow-up for exactly which write paths this does
        and doesn't reach (several either write outside any `transaction()`
        block at all, or, per the already-resolved KI-035, evaluate policy
        against a read taken before the transaction opens).

        Trade-off worth knowing (KI-084 review): `self._lock` is acquired
        *before* the `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` call below, so while this call is
        parked in SQLite's busy handler waiting out a cross-process writer,
        every other `@_synchronized` call on this process — reads included
        — blocks behind it too, for up to the full `busy_timeout`. This
        can't be avoided by acquiring the lock later: only one Python
        thread may safely touch the single shared `self.conn` at a time
        regardless of which statement is running, so narrowing the lock's
        span here would just reopen KI-023 (two threads issuing statements
        on one connection concurrently) instead. The WAL claim elsewhere in
        this file ("readers don't block behind writers") holds at the
        SQLite level; it does not hold at this process's own read
        availability once a `begin()` here is genuinely contended by
        another process. See KI-084's `docs/adr/ADR-0001-storage-default.md`
        update for the deployment-facing version of this same trade-off.
