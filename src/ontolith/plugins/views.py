"""Capability-scoped facades over Ontology for plugin code (ADR-0015).

ReadOnlyView and WriteView expose only a safe method subset of Ontology.
Admin-only methods (issue_token, apply_schema, create_principal,
accept_proposal, reject_proposal, resolve_contradiction, flag_contradiction)
and the direct-write bypass methods (assert_literal, assert_ref) are
STRUCTURALLY ABSENT — not runtime-checked — so a plugin using the intended
API surface cannot reach them, and the omission cannot regress silently the
way a runtime check could if someone forgot to call it.

Every mutating method hardcodes `author` to the view's own bound principal
id — there is no `acting_as` parameter on any view method. Delegation is a
human/AI-owner concept (ADR-0003); letting a plugin act as another principal
would reopen the spoofing class of bug ADR-0014 closed.

This is a governance-correctness boundary, not a security sandbox: Python
has no true encapsulation, so code that deliberately reaches past a view's
private `_kb` reference is not stopped by this module. See ADR-0015
Consequences for the full statement of what this does and doesn't defend
against.
