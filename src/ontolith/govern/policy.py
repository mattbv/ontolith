    Corroboration is checked against ``kb``'s pinned-at-``created_at`` state

    its entire purpose is *which reviewers* a proposal gets routed to, not
    whether it needs review in the first place. A deployment that also
    wants some proposals to skip review entirely composes this with an
    accepting strategy via ``Composite(any=[...])`` (ADR-0040); used alone,
    every proposal it evaluates lands in ``require_review``.

    "Role" has no dedicated field on ``Principal`` — SPEC names ``kind``
    (human/ai/service), capability, and trust level, but nothing called
    "role". This strategy reads ``principal.metadata.get("role")``:
    ``Principal.metadata`` is already documented as "open JSON blob for
    future extension", exactly the mechanism a deployment-specific concept
    like organizational role is meant to use without requiring a schema
    change to ``Principal`` itself. This is a deliberate, not accidental,
    choice — see ADR-0045 for the alternatives considered (a dedicated
    ``Principal.role`` field, keying by ``kind`` instead) and why they were
    rejected.

    Role is read from ``principal`` (the author) only, never from
    ``acting_as`` — mirroring ``ThresholdPolicy``'s "AI's own kind is never
    laundered away by delegating" precedent (ADR-0003): reviewer routing is
    about who is really proposing, not who they're temporarily acting as,
    so delegation can't be used to dodge a role's assigned reviewers.

    A missing role, a non-``str`` role (``metadata`` is an unvalidated
    ``dict[str, Any]``), and an unmapped role all fall back to ``default``
    — each distinguished in the returned reason text, so callers can tell

    Promotes the composition pattern ``Composite``'s own docstring has
    sketched inline since ADR-0040 into a real, exported, tested class —
    ``ThresholdPolicy`` is the only strategy that unconditionally routes
    AI-kind principals to review; every KB-inspecting strategy in this
    module (``SourceQuorum``, ``ConfidenceThreshold``) deliberately does
    not special-case AI authorship on its own (KI-061, ADR-0025), so a
    deployment that wants both writes and composes a small AI-blocking
    strategy — this is that strategy, shippable instead of hand-derived
    from a comment each time::

        policy = Composite(all=[RequireReviewForAI(), SourceQuorum(2)])

    This is not a reversal of KI-061/ADR-0040's decision to not ship an
    "AI-always-reviews" strategy bundled with `SourceQuorum`'s own
    capability/trust checks — using the whole of ``ThresholdPolicy`` here
    would re-impose *its* capability gate too, defeating the point of
    choosing a different strategy in the first place. ``RequireReviewForAI``
    does only the one thing its name says.

    Rejects principals without at least ``propose`` capability first,
    matching every sibling strategy's own KI-015 floor enforcement
    (``docs/known-issues.md`) — checked *before* the AI-kind test, unlike
    ``ThresholdPolicy``'s ordering (AI-kind first, capability math never
    reached for an AI author). ``ThresholdPolicy`` can get away with
    AI-first because it has no other reachable outcome for a read-only AI
    that would differ; here, checking capability first means a read-only
    principal of *any* kind is rejected the same way every other strategy
    in this module already rejects one, rather than a read-only AI
    reaching ``RequireReview`` (a working, if misleading, outcome) while a
    read-only human reaches it via a different, uncomposed strategy's own
    check. Composition doesn't change the practical result either way —
    ``Composite(all=...)``'s most-restrictive-wins merge treats
    ``Reject``/``RequireReview`` identically as "the group doesn't
    auto-accept" — but this class enforces its own floor rather than
    depending on being composed with a strategy that does, so it behaves
    correctly standalone too.

    AI-kind is read from ``principal`` (the author) only, never from
    ``acting_as`` — mirroring ``ThresholdPolicy``'s "AI's own kind is
    never laundered away by delegating" precedent (comment at this
    module's ``ThresholdPolicy.evaluate``; SPEC §8.4 defines delegation's
    effective *capability* as the more conservative of the two principals,
    but says nothing about laundering *kind*, so this strategy makes the
    same explicit choice every other kind-sensitive check in this module
    already makes).

    ``Composite(all=…, any=…)``).

    Every strategy in ``all`` must independently return ``AutoAccept`` for
    the ``all`` group to approve — a single ``Reject``/``RequireReview``
    anywhere in the group overrides every ``AutoAccept`` the others
    returned. At least one strategy in ``any`` must return ``AutoAccept``
    for the ``any`` group to approve. Both groups must approve for
    ``Composite`` itself to auto-accept (an unset group is excluded from
    the combination entirely, rather than contributing a placeholder
    decision — a caller passing only ``all=`` or only ``any=`` gets exactly
    that group's own semantics, unconstrained by the other).

    This is SPEC §9.2's sanctioned way to layer an unconditional rule (e.g.
    ThresholdPolicy's "AI principals always require review", ADR-0003) on
    top of a KB-inspecting strategy like ``SourceQuorum``, which
    deliberately does not special-case AI authorship on its own (KI-061,
    ADR-0025 §5). ``RequireReviewForAI`` (KI-088) is exactly that small
    unconditional-half strategy, shipped rather than hand-derived::

        policy = Composite(all=[RequireReviewForAI(), SourceQuorum(2)])

    Ontolith does not ship a standalone "AI always requires review"
    strategy *bundled with a capability-checking one* — using the whole
    of ``ThresholdPolicy`` here would re-impose *its* capability gate too,
    defeating the point of choosing ``SourceQuorum`` in the first place —
    but ``RequireReviewForAI`` alone, composed explicitly like this, is
    exactly that pattern made real.

    When multiple strategies in the same group land at the same decision
    severity (e.g. two ``RequireReview``s), their reviewers are merged as a
    dedup'd union and their reasons are concatenated — every contributing
    strategy's rationale is preserved, not just the first one evaluated.

    Reads via ``kb`` are still permitted (this composes, not replaces, the
    contained strategies) — purity/determinism holds as long as every
    contained strategy holds it.

    ``Composite`` does not itself enforce KI-015's read-capability floor
    (``docs/known-issues.md``: "any future ``PolicyStrategy`` needs to make
    the same deliberate choice; it is not inherited for free") — it is
    exactly as permissive or restrictive as its contained strategies, by
    design, since it is a combinator rather than a leaf strategy. This is
    safe for ``all=``: any member's own ``Reject`` for a read-capability
    principal (e.g. ``SourceQuorum``'s) still wins, since ``all`` uses the
    most-restrictive decision. It is a real sharp edge for ``any=``: if one
    member in the group doesn't check capability at all and would
    otherwise ``AutoAccept``, that member's decision can win the group even
    though a stricter sibling (like ``SourceQuorum``) would have rejected
    the same principal — the same "OR" semantics that let one strategy's
    approval cover for another's stricter rule also let it cover for a
    missing capability check. Every strategy composed into an ``any=``
    group should enforce the floor itself if that matters for the
    deployment, the same way ``SourceQuorum`` already does.
