"""Governance layer - proposals, policy, review, conflict resolution.

This module handles the write path and governance:
- Proposals: staged operations awaiting approval
- Policy: pure functions for auto-accept/review decisions
- Review: human approval workflow (M2)
- Conflict: temporal supersession and contradictions (M2)

`ProposalState`/`ContradictionState` (the `Literal` type aliases annotating
`Proposal.state`/`Contradiction.state`, both pinned attributes of pinned
classes) and `safe_rationale_history` (the defensive coercion every read
surface projecting `Contradiction.metadata["rationale_history"]` needs,
since `metadata` is an open, schema-less blob) are exported here for the
same reason `AsOfView`/`AuthProvider`/`VECTOR_SCOPES` were added to their
own packages during the M4 API-surface-freeze audit (ADR-0019's Update) —
each was already public in spirit (declared in its own module's `__all__`)
but unreachable from this package.
