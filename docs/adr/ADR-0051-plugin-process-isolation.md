# ADR-0051: Plugin Process Isolation

**Status:** Accepted

**Date:** 2026-09-19

**Deciders:** Ontolith Core Team

## Context

ADR-0015 gave plugins a *governance-correctness* boundary: `PluginRegistry.register()` loads a
plugin behind a capability-scoped view (`ReadOnlyView`/`WriteView`), so admin-only methods and the
direct-write bypass are structurally absent from what a plugin can reach. It explicitly did **not**
close `docs/known-issues.md` KI-014's other half: `capabilities.network`/`.filesystem` are declared
in the manifest but never enforced. A plugin still runs fully in-process, sharing the same Python
interpreter, memory space, and OS process as the host application — nothing stops it from
`import requests`-ing out to the network or `open()`-ing an arbitrary file, regardless of what its
manifest declares. ADR-0015 named this explicitly: "Python has no true encapsulation... this design
closes the *structural/accidental* bypass... it does **not** close a plugin author who deliberately
writes code to defeat the convention. That gap closes only with process/wasm isolation."

The Implementation Plan (§8) phases this as "process isolation in v1, wasm/subprocess hardening +
signed registry plugins by 1.0." M4 is that 1.0 milestone. Four real reference plugins
(`CsvImporter`, `JsonExporter`, `RdfExporter`, `RequiredFieldsValidator`) now ship against the
`Importer`/`Exporter`/`Validator` protocols, so — unlike when ADR-0015 rejected building this
"before any real plugin exists to run in it" — there is now real, exercised surface to isolate.

The user chose to build real process isolation now (not an ADR-only scoping pass, not a lighter
in-process-only mitigation), so this ADR records the design decided as part of building it, per the
project's own "record a decision before implementing it" convention — this is a single PR that
ships both.

## Decision

**Each plugin's protocol entrypoint (`import_`/`export`/`derive`/`validate`/`sync`) runs in a
freshly spawned child process, with its `kb` view (and any other live object it's handed)
proxied back to the parent over IPC. Network/filesystem denial is enforced at the OS syscall level
on Linux (via seccomp); on platforms without that primitive, the process/IPC boundary is the only
enforcement, honestly documented as such.**

### Process and IPC model (`src/ontolith/plugins/sandbox/`)

- **One child process per call, not per plugin lifetime.** `multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")`
  is used unconditionally (not `fork`) — `spawn` behaves identically on Linux/macOS/Windows (all
  three are in this project's CI matrix), unlike `fork`, which is POSIX-only and unsafe to mix with
  the threads/locks `Ontology`'s own concurrency story (KI-023/KI-084) already relies on. A fresh
  process per call means no plugin state persists between calls (each entrypoint call reconstructs
  the plugin instance from scratch, same as a fresh `plugin_class()` per invocation) and no partially
  -compromised process lingers to serve a second call — the more conservative, defense-in-depth
  choice over a long-lived worker process, and the reference plugins are already effectively
  stateless per-call (the one plugin with constructor state, `RequiredFieldsValidator`, is only ever
  constructed no-argument by the registry, per its own docstring).
- **The plugin is reconstructed inside the child from the same `entry_point_name` string the
  registry already resolved once in the parent** (for the existing manifest/construction
  validation `PluginRegistry.register()` already performs, unchanged by this ADR) — not by pickling
  the parent's already-constructed instance across the boundary. This means the untrusted plugin's
  own `__init__` runs a second time, once in each process; the parent's copy exists only to validate
  early (preserving `register()`'s existing error-timing contract) and is discarded, never invoked
  again.
- **Exactly one duplex `multiprocessing.Pipe()` per call**, not one channel per proxied object.
  Every message is tagged (`"kb"` for the view argument, `"arg_<position>"` for any other live
  object needing a callback) so a single pipe can carry interleaved requests for more than one
  remote object — in practice at most a `kb` view and one writable target, per the Protocol shapes
  in `plugins/ports.py`. The exchange is fully synchronous: the child blocks on each proxied call
  until it gets a reply, so there is never more than one in-flight request, and no reason for a more
  elaborate multiplexed transport.
- **Object detection is by structural type, not argument position or keyword name.** Any argument
  (positional or keyword) that is a `ReadOnlyView`/`WriteView` instance is always proxied, never
  pickled — this works uniformly across `Importer.import_(source, kb)`, `Exporter.export(kb,
  target)`, `Reasoner.derive(kb)`, `Validator.validate(assertion, kb)`, and `Connector.sync(kb)`
  without hardcoding each protocol's argument order. Any other argument is pickled directly if
  possible (covers the paths/strings/dicts/lists every reference plugin actually passes); if pickling
  fails **and** the value exposes a callable `.write` attribute, it is wrapped in a remote-writable
  proxy instead (covers `JsonExporter`/`RdfExporter`'s documented `io.StringIO`-as-`target` support);
  otherwise the caller gets a clear `UnwirableArgumentError` (a `TypeError` subclass) at call time,
  before a child process is even spawned, naming the argument type that can't cross the boundary.
- **`RemoteReadOnlyView`/`RemoteWriteView`** (`sandbox/remote_view.py`) mirror `ReadOnlyView`/
  `WriteView`'s public method set (including `principal_id`, a plain string carried on the wire
  marker so no round trip is needed for it) and the *relationship between the two proxy classes*
  (`RemoteWriteView` subclasses `RemoteReadOnlyView`, mirroring `WriteView`/`ReadOnlyView`'s own
  shape) — they do **not** subclass the real `ReadOnlyView`/`WriteView` themselves, so
  `isinstance(kb, WriteView)` against the real class is `False` inside a sandboxed call, even for a
  writable registration (`isinstance(kb, RemoteWriteView)` is the isolated-call equivalent). Every
  method body sends one request over the pipe and blocks for the reply instead of calling `Ontology`
  directly — nothing else. `.query()`/
  `.as_of()` are **not supported in an isolated call** in this pass: both return fluent builder
  objects (`QueryBuilder`/`AsOfView`) that hold a live backend reference and support chained calls,
  which would need their own remote-proxy protocol; no shipped reference plugin calls either method,
  so building that proxy now would be speculative. Calling `kb.query(...)`/`kb.as_of(...)` from
  inside an isolated plugin raises a clear `PluginError` naming this limitation, tracked as this
  ADR's own follow-up (see Consequences), not silently broken.
- **Exceptions cross the boundary pickled directly wherever possible.** `BaseException`'s own
  `__reduce__` includes `__dict__` as reconstruction state, not just `self.args` — so an
  `OntolithError` subclass (`core/errors.py`) round-trips through a plain pickle correctly with no
  special-casing needed: `message` and `detail` both come back exactly as they went in, and so does
  the concrete exception type (verified directly, not assumed — see `sandbox/wire.py`'s tests). A
  non-`OntolithError` exception a plugin's own code raises is pickled the same way (covers ordinary
  `ValueError`/`TypeError`/etc.); if a third-party exception type isn't picklable at all, it
  degrades to a plain `RuntimeError` carrying the original type name and message —
  documented as a known, narrow fidelity loss for that one case, not a silent one (the message
  always survives; only the exact exception *type* doesn't, when it can't).

### Enforcement (`sandbox/enforcement.py`)

- **Linux: real, OS-level denial via seccomp** (`pyseccomp`, an optional dependency gated by the
  `sys_platform == "linux"` environment marker in `pyproject.toml`, so it never installs on
  macOS/Windows). Immediately before the child calls into the plugin's actual entrypoint method —
  after every import the runner infrastructure itself needs, since Python's own import machinery
  does filesystem reads that must not be blocked — a `seccomp.SyscallFilter(defaction=ALLOW)` is
  built and loaded denying (via `ERRNO(EPERM)`, not `KILL_PROCESS`) the network syscall group
  (`socket`, `connect`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`/`accept4`, `send*`, `recv*`, `getsockopt`,
  `setsockopt`, `shutdown`) when `capabilities.network` is `False`, and the filesystem-mutation
  syscall group (`open`, `openat`, `openat2`, `creat`, `unlink*`, `rename*`, `mkdir*`, `rmdir`,
  `chmod*`, `chown*`, `truncate*`, `link*`, `symlink*`) when `capabilities.filesystem` is `False`.
  `ERRNO(EPERM)` rather than killing the process means a denied syscall surfaces as an ordinary
  Python `OSError`/`PermissionError` at the plugin's own call site — caught and propagated through
  the same exception-wire path as any other plugin-raised exception, not a special "process died"
  case the parent has to detect via a closed pipe. Already-open file descriptors (stdio, the IPC
  pipe itself) are unaffected — the filter blocks *new* filesystem access, not continued use of
  what's already open, so the RPC protocol itself keeps working under a `filesystem=False` filter.
- **macOS/Windows: no OS-level enforcement in this pass.** `sandbox-exec` (macOS) and Windows job
  objects/AppContainers are real primitives that could eventually close this the same way, but each
  is a materially different, platform-specific mechanism from seccomp, unverifiable in this
  project's own development environment, and every one of the three OSes in this project's CI
  matrix (`ubuntu-latest`/`macos-latest`/`windows-latest`) would need its own tested path before
  this ADR could honestly claim it — building two more platform-specific sandboxes speculatively,
  without a way to verify either actually restricts anything, would be worse than shipping the one
  that's real and saying so. On these platforms, a plugin's declared `network=False`/
  `filesystem=False` is still not enforced — the process/IPC boundary (no direct object reachability,
  crash isolation) is the only real improvement there, same class of gap ADR-0015 already
  documented, just now qualified to "on this platform" instead of "at all." `PluginRegistry`'s
  existing registration-time `WARNING` (ADR-0015's 2026-08-30 update) is reworded to say exactly
  this, rather than imply nothing has changed.
- **Enforcement failing to install degrades to the same "not enforced, loudly said so" state, never
  silently.** `pyseccomp`'s import can fail two ways: the package isn't installed at all
  (`ImportError`, expected on macOS/Windows since the dependency is platform-gated) or it's
  installed but `libseccomp.so` isn't present on the host (`RuntimeError`, raised by `pyseccomp`
  itself at import time) — CI's `ubuntu-latest` job installs `libseccomp2` via `apt-get` specifically
  so this path is exercised for real there, not merely imported successfully. Either failure is
  caught once, produces the same "no OS-level enforcement available" result as running on a
  non-Linux platform, and is logged through `kb.observability` (ADR-0044) at `WARNING`, not raised —
  a plugin that declared `network=False` should still run, just without the stronger guarantee, the
  same posture ADR-0015 already established for "declared but not enforced."

### `PluginRegistry` surface

- **`register()` gains `isolate: bool = True`.** Deny-by-default extends here the same way it
  already governs default temporality, MCP's read/propose/flag-only default, and capability floors
  defaulting to `propose`: a plugin registered with no explicit opt-out runs isolated. `isolate=False`
  is the documented escape hatch for a plugin whose `source`/`target` genuinely can't cross a process
  boundary at all (an unpicklable, non-`.write`-shaped live object) or for a fully trusted first-party
  plugin where the overhead of a subprocess per call isn't worth paying — it restores exactly today's
  pre-ADR-0051 behavior, unchanged.
- **`LoadedPlugin.instance` becomes an `IsolatedPluginProxy`** when `isolate=True` — a thin object
  exposing only the one protocol method `manifest.kind` implies (`import_`/`export`/`derive`/
  `validate`/`sync`), matching `plugins/ports.py`'s Protocols exactly. Calling it runs the full
  spawn-proxy-collect-result cycle above and returns/raises exactly what the real, unsandboxed call
  would have. `isinstance(loaded.instance, CsvImporter)`-style checks (a few existed in tests before
  this ADR) no longer hold for an isolated registration — expected, since `loaded.instance` is no
  longer the real object at all; `IsolatedPluginProxy.plugin_class` exposes the class being wrapped
  for exactly this kind of identity check.
- **Everything before that point in `register()` — entry-point resolution, manifest validation,
  capability negotiation, principal creation, the existing unenforced-capability warning, admin-event
  recording — is unchanged.** This ADR only replaces what `LoadedPlugin.instance` *is* and how calling
  its one method behaves; it does not touch how a plugin gets discovered, validated, or granted a
  capability.

## Rationale

**Why a fresh subprocess per call instead of a long-lived worker:** the reference plugins carry no
meaningful state between calls (each entrypoint call is a complete, self-contained unit of work —
import this file, export this snapshot, validate this assertion), so there's no efficiency loss
worth trading away the security benefit of never letting a second call reuse a process a first call
already ran untrusted code in.

**Why type-based object detection instead of one proxy-construction path per plugin kind:** the five
Protocols in `plugins/ports.py` don't agree on where `kb` sits in the argument list (`Exporter`
takes it first, `Importer` takes it second) — hardcoding a position per kind would work today but
silently break the moment a future Protocol's `kb` isn't in the position assumed, with no type
error to catch it (both positions type as `object` from the wire's perspective). Detecting `kb` by
`isinstance(value, ReadOnlyView)` instead makes the marshalling code Protocol-shape-agnostic: it
would keep working correctly even for a new plugin kind this ADR didn't anticipate, as long as that
kind still hands a `ReadOnlyView`/`WriteView` to the plugin somewhere in its call.

**Why seccomp specifically, and why only on Linux:** seccomp-bpf is a mature, well-audited Linux
kernel primitive purpose-built for exactly this ("restrict which syscalls a process may make"),
usable by an unprivileged process (`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`, which `pyseccomp`/libseccomp already
handle internally), and testable in this project's own `ubuntu-latest` CI job. macOS's nearest
equivalent, `sandbox-exec`, is an Apple-private, undocumented, and repeatedly-flagged-for-eventual-
removal mechanism with no first-party Python binding this project could adopt with the same
confidence; Windows has no directly comparable per-syscall primitive at all (job objects and
AppContainers restrict different things — processes, tokens, resource limits — not arbitrary syscall
denial). Shipping a real mechanism on the one platform where one exists, rather than a best-effort
approximation on all three that this project has no way to verify actually restricts anything, is
the more honest choice — matching this ADR's own "say so, don't imply a guarantee that isn't there"
stance, the same one ADR-0015 already took for the gap this ADR partially closes.

**Why `ERRNO(EPERM)` instead of `KILL_PROCESS` as the seccomp deny action:** a killed process turns
every denied syscall into an abrupt pipe closure the parent has to detect (`EOFError` on `recv()`)
and translate into some generic "the plugin's process died" error, losing the specific syscall/
capability that triggered it. `ERRNO(EPERM)` instead surfaces as an ordinary Python exception
(`PermissionError`/`OSError`) at the exact call the plugin's own code made, which the sandbox's
already-built exception-wire path (needed regardless, for a plugin's own `ValidationError`/
`ValueError`/etc.) propagates back to the parent with no separate handling required — one mechanism
covers both "the plugin raised on purpose" and "the sandbox denied a syscall," rather than two.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- ✅ Closes the "Python has no true encapsulation" gap ADR-0015 named as unclosed: a plugin's own
  code, isolated in a separate OS process with only a picklable-message IPC channel to the parent,
  cannot reach `view._kb` or any other live object graph at all — there is no longer an object to
  reach past, on any platform, regardless of seccomp availability. This is real, structural value
  independent of the network/filesystem enforcement question.
- ✅ On Linux, `capabilities.network=False`/`capabilities.filesystem=False` are now genuinely
  enforced at the OS syscall level, closing SPEC §17's "MUST deny undeclared access" for the
  platform this project can actually verify it on.
- ✅ A plugin crash (segfault, unhandled fatal error, resource exhaustion) can no longer take down
  the host process — it's a different OS process now.

**Negative:**
- ⚠️ **macOS/Windows get no OS-level network/filesystem enforcement in this pass** — the same
  "declared but not enforced" gap ADR-0015 left open, now qualified by platform rather than closed
  everywhere. Tracked as this ADR's own follow-up (see below), not re-opening KI-014 from scratch —
  the Linux half is genuinely resolved.
- ⚠️ **`.query()`/`.as_of()` are unavailable from inside an isolated plugin call** — a real, if
  currently unused, capability regression for a hypothetical future plugin wanting the fluent query
  builder rather than `assertions()`'s flat filter. Filed as a follow-up (see below).
- ⚠️ **A subprocess-per-call has real, if modest, latency and resource cost** (process spawn,
  pickling overhead) compared to a direct in-process call — not measured against this project's SPEC
  §9 performance budgets, since none of those budgets name plugin invocation; `isolate=False` is the
  documented opt-out for a caller who has already decided this overhead isn't worth paying for a
  specific, trusted registration.
- ⚠️ **A plugin's module import and constructor still run once, unsandboxed, in the parent process**
  (unchanged from ADR-0015/`register()`'s existing behavior — `entry_point.load()` imports the
  plugin's module, then `plugin_class()` constructs it) purely to validate the manifest and catch a
  broken `__init__` early, before the security-relevant boundary this ADR adds even applies —
  arbitrary module-level code, not just the constructor, runs with full parent privileges at this
  point (round-2 review finding: naming only "constructor" here understated the exposure by one
  step). An operator registering a plugin at all is already an explicit trust decision (`register()`
  requires `admin` capability, unchanged), so this is the same trust boundary ADR-0015 already relied
  on, not a new one this ADR introduces — but it is, honestly, the single largest remaining
  unsandboxed surface in this design.
- ⚠️ **A third-party exception type that isn't picklable loses its exact type crossing the
  boundary** (degrades to a plain `RuntimeError` carrying the original name and message) — documented
  above, a narrow fidelity loss versus `isolate=False`'s exact-type-preserving behavior.

## Alternatives Considered

**A long-lived worker process per registered plugin, reused across calls:** rejected — no shipped
plugin needs cross-call state, and a persistent worker means a single compromised or buggy call
taints every subsequent call to the same plugin for the lifetime of the registration, not just the
one call that went wrong.

**WASM-based plugin execution** (compiling plugins to WASM, run under a WASM runtime like
`wasmtime`): rejected for this pass, matching the Implementation Plan's own phasing ("process
isolation... wasm/subprocess hardening... by 1.0" as two distinct, sequenced items, not one). WASM
would require every plugin author to compile to WASM instead of writing ordinary Python against
`plugins/ports.py`'s Protocols — a fundamentally different plugin-authoring model than the one all
four shipped reference plugins and this project's entry-point-based discovery already assume.
Building it now would mean redesigning plugin authorship from scratch, not hardening the existing
one; tracked as a distinct, later follow-up per the Implementation Plan's own sequencing, not
folded into "process isolation."

**A capability-restricted `StorageBackend`/socket-module monkeypatch instead of OS-level
enforcement:** rejected for the same reason ADR-0015 rejected a `StorageBackend` wrapper for the
storage half — an in-process Python-level restriction (replacing `socket.socket`, `builtins.open`,
etc. inside the child) can be trivially defeated by a deliberately malicious plugin (`ctypes`,
re-importing the original via `importlib.reload` on a saved reference, a compiled extension module
that doesn't go through Python's `socket`/`open` at all) — it would raise the bar for a careless
plugin without closing the gap ADR-0015 already named as the more consequential one: a plugin author
who deliberately writes code to defeat the convention. Only a kernel-enforced boundary (seccomp) or
a genuine process/VM boundary actually closes that.

**Signed registry plugins:** out of scope for this ADR, per the Implementation Plan's own phasing
("wasm/subprocess hardening **+ signed registry plugins**" as one bundled 1.0 item, both still
follow-ups here) — this ADR's isolation model is orthogonal to whether a plugin's source is verified
before it's ever loaded; signing addresses a different threat (a tampered or spoofed plugin
distribution), not what a legitimately-installed plugin's own code can do once it runs.

## Update (2026-09-20): review found two CRITICAL bypasses of the process boundary itself — fixed

Two independent review rounds (architecture + a dedicated security review) both found, independently,
that the first version of this ADR's own IPC design gave a malicious plugin a **better** path to the
parent than the in-process design it replaced — directly contradicting the "no object graph left to
reach past" claim this ADR originally made. Both are fixed; the claim is accurate now, verified by
direct reproduction of both attacks against the fixed code (not merely re-reading the fix).

**CRITICAL-1 — the dispatch loop unpickled attacker-controlled bytes, which is arbitrary code
execution.** `multiprocessing.Connection.recv()` is `pickle.loads()`; the child process is untrusted
by this ADR's own threat model; therefore a plugin's own `DONE`/`FAILED`/`CALL` message — including
its own return value, its own raised exception, or any argument it passes through a proxied view
call — could carry an object whose `__reduce__` calls an arbitrary importable callable (e.g.
`os.system`) the instant `.loads()` runs, before any of this project's own code executes. Reproduced:
a plugin returning an object with a hostile `__reduce__` ran a shell command in the **parent**
process. Fixed two ways, together: (1) `sandbox/wire.py`'s `RestrictedUnpickler`/`restricted_loads`
— the parent now reads every message from the child via `recv_bytes()` and a custom `Unpickler`
whose `find_class` refuses to construct any class instance not on an explicit allowlist (every
`OntolithError` subclass plus a short list of ordinary builtin exceptions); every other value must
arrive as one of `None`/`bool`/`int`/`float`/`str`/`bytes`/`list`/`dict`/`tuple`, which pickle's own
opcodes handle without ever calling `find_class` at all. (2) `wire.to_wire_result` — a plugin's own
return value is reduced to that same JSON-safe shape before it's ever sent (a `@dataclass` becomes a
plain `dict`, each field value recursively reduced the same way — deliberately not
`dataclasses.asdict()`, which would `deepcopy` a non-dataclass field value unrestricted and could
defeat this same guarantee), so the common case (a reference plugin's `ImportReport`-shaped return
value) never needs the restricted unpickler to reconstruct an arbitrary class at all.
**This means a plugin's dataclass-shaped return value now crosses an isolated call as a `dict`, not
its original type — `isolate=False` still returns the real object unchanged.**

**CRITICAL-2 — the dispatch loop invoked any method name the child asked for, on the real,
unproxied view object.** `getattr(real_view, call_method_name)(*call_args, **call_kwargs)` had no
allow-list; `call_method_name` came directly from the child's own `CALL` message. Reproduced: a
plugin registered with `ReadOnlyView`-only, `write`-incapable access called
`kb._call("__setattr__", "_principal_id", "admin@example.com")` on its own proxy, which forwarded
verbatim to `__setattr__` on the parent's real, live view object — successfully forging the acting
principal on every subsequent write through that view (the view object is long-lived on
`LoadedPlugin.view`, so the poisoning outlives the one call). No pickle trickery needed — plain
strings. Fixed: `runner.py`'s `_allowed_methods_for` is now an explicit, closed allow-list
(`get_entity`/`schema`/`assertions`/`create_entity`/`propose`/`propose_ref`/`retract`/`write` —
never a dunder, never `query()`/`as_of()`, which would hand back a live `QueryBuilder`/`AsOfView`
holding a backend reference), consulted before `getattr` ever runs. `RestrictedUnpickler` alone does
**not** close this: `__setattr__` and its arguments are all safe, ordinary strings.

**Other fixes from the same two review rounds, smaller but real:**
- **Call-time enforcement failures were silently discarded.** The registration-time warning
  (`registry.py`) predicts whether Linux+seccomp *should* work; it can't guarantee the per-call
  attempt actually succeeds (a container's own outer seccomp profile, say). The child now reports
  its `EnforcementResult` to the parent unconditionally (a new `ENFORCEMENT` protocol message,
  before the plugin's own method runs), and the parent logs a `WARNING` through `kb.observability`
  whenever it didn't apply — `IsolatedPluginProxy`/`run_isolated` now take an `observability`
  parameter for this.
- **The registration-time warning logic was checking the wrong condition.** It only fired when a
  capability was declared `True` (an *allow*, never restricted by seccomp on any platform — the
  original, correct ADR-0015 concern) — but suppressed itself whenever Linux enforcement was
  predicted available, which has no bearing on the `True` case at all. Worse, it never warned about
  a capability declared `False` (the default) when *that* declaration wouldn't actually be enforced
  either (macOS/Windows, or `isolate=False`) — exactly the silent-false-sense-of-enforcement case
  this warning exists to prevent. `registry.py`'s `_warn_if_unenforced_capabilities_requested` now
  checks both conditions independently and can log up to two distinct warnings per registration.
- **`_child_main`'s independent entry-point resolution had drifted from `PluginRegistry`'s.** It
  silently picked the first match on an ambiguous entry-point name instead of refusing, unlike
  `register()`'s own check. Now mirrors `_load_entry_point`'s error handling exactly.
- **`RemoteReadOnlyView`/`RemoteWriteView` were missing `principal_id`** (a real `ReadOnlyView`
  public property) and did not actually subclass the real `ReadOnlyView`/`WriteView` despite this
  ADR's original text claiming `isinstance(kb, WriteView)` "still holds" inside a sandboxed call —
  it doesn't; only `isinstance(kb, RemoteWriteView)` does. `principal_id` now crosses via the wire
  marker (a plain string, no round trip needed); the `isinstance` claim above is corrected.
- **The seccomp syscall deny-lists had real gaps**, per the security review: `io_uring_setup`/
  `_enter`/`_register` (the standard bypass — submits socket/openat/send/recv-shaped operations via
  kernel worker threads, never issuing the syscalls seccomp filters individually), `ptrace`/
  `process_vm_readv`/`process_vm_writev` (a direct route into the parent's memory on a host that
  hasn't hardened `ptrace_scope`, unrelated to network/filesystem but squarely inside "reach past the
  process boundary"), several filesystem syscalls (`fchmod`/`fchown`/`lchown`/`mknod`/`mknodat`/
  `fallocate`/`utimensat`/the `*xattr` family/`open_by_handle_at`/the newer mount API), and
  non-native-architecture syscalls (a 32-bit compat or x32 syscall on x86_64 matches no rule under a
  filter that only registered the native architecture, falling through to `ALLOW`). All added;
  `ptrace`/`process_vm_*` are denied unconditionally whenever any restriction is installed, not
  gated on which capability was declared `False`.
- **`pyseccomp`'s version range was loosely pinned** (`>=0.1,<1.0`) for a thin, infrequently-updated
  dependency that is the entire security boundary for network/filesystem denial — exact-pinned now
  (`==0.1.2`), matching `sqlite-vec`'s own precedent and stated reasoning in `pyproject.toml`.
- **A validator loaded via `Ontology`'s own `validators`/`completeness_validators` constructor
  parameters cannot be an `IsolatedPluginProxy`** — that path passes the trusted `Ontology` itself as
  `kb` (per ADR-0029, always unsandboxed, unrelated to `PluginRegistry`), which isn't a
  `ReadOnlyView` and isn't picklable, so it can't cross the sandbox boundary at all. This was never a
  supported combination and remains none — `plugins/ports.py`'s `ValidatorKbView` docstring now says
  so explicitly. Calling a `PluginRegistry`-loaded validator the same way every other plugin kind is
  called (`loaded.instance.validate(assertion, loaded.view)`) works correctly and is covered by a
  test — verified directly, not assumed.
- `UnwirableArgumentError` (a `TypeError` subclass) is what a caller actually gets for an argument
  that can't cross the boundary, raised at call time — this ADR's Decision section previously named
  a different exception type at a different time, both wrong; corrected.

**Round-2 review — both CRITICAL fixes independently re-verified via 12+16 reproduction variants
(hostile-pickle payloads and dispatch-escalation attempts, respectively, plus a full end-to-end run
with a real malicious plugin under a real entry point) — both hold, no third bypass of the process
boundary found. Six smaller issues found and fixed in the same round:**
- `wire_exception` checked the exception's full **MRO** against the allowlist, not its concrete
  class — since every exception's MRO includes `("builtins", "Exception")` (itself allowlisted), the
  check always passed regardless of the concrete type, so the documented `RuntimeError` fallback
  never fired for a picklable-but-not-allowlisted exception (e.g. a plugin-defined `MyValueError`).
  The parent's `restricted_loads` then refused the concrete class outright, destroying the
  exception's message entirely instead of degrading gracefully. Fixed: checks
  `(type(exc).__module__, type(exc).__name__)` — the concrete class — matching
  `RestrictedUnpickler.find_class`'s own check exactly.
- A malformed message's own *shape* (wrong arity, an unhashable tag or method name) previously
  escaped `_dispatch_loop` as a raw `ValueError`/`TypeError`/`IndexError`, contradicting
  `run_isolated`'s own documented `PluginError` contract for "a malformed or disallowed message" —
  `restricted_loads` already kept every value's *content* safe, this closes the same hole for the
  message's own shape. Fixed: message handling is wrapped so any such error is converted to
  `PluginError` and the child process is terminated, the same severity as an `UnpicklingError`.
- `to_wire_result` reduced a dict's *values* but not its *keys* — a hostile key still failed closed
  (the parent's `restricted_loads` refuses it regardless), but the function's own "JSON-safe" promise
  didn't hold for keys. Fixed: keys are reduced too.
- The new `ENFORCEMENT` message had no cap on how many a child could send — a child sending
  thousands produced one `WARNING` per message through `kb.observability`, a log-amplification
  vector. Fixed: only the first `ENFORCEMENT` message per call is honored.
- Added `execve`/`execveat` to the filesystem deny-list: the kernel opens the target program image
  internally, bypassing `open`/`openat`, so `filesystem=False` previously denied *reading* a file's
  contents but not *running* it as a new program. Bounded even before this fix — an installed filter
  is inherited across `execve` (`NO_NEW_PRIVS`), so the new image runs under the same restrictions,
  not a wider set — but worth closing directly rather than relying on that as the only mitigation.
- **The `ENFORCEMENT` message is self-reported by the untrusted child, so a malicious plugin can
  forge it** (report `applied=True` when it isn't, or send nothing at all) — not fixed, and
  deliberately so: the message is a diagnostic courtesy for a *cooperating* plugin/operator
  debugging a misconfiguration, not a security control. Forging it doesn't weaken what's actually
  enforced (the real seccomp filter state is entirely independent of what the child claims about
  it) — it can only make the operator-facing warning wrong, which a plugin author with no reason to
  lie (accepting the manifest's own declared capabilities) never triggers. Documented here so the
  distinction is explicit, not implied.
- **A `filesystem=True` registration (already drawing its own loud "declared, not enforced" warning)
  can still reach the parent's memory via `/proc/<ppid>/mem`**, the file-based equivalent of the
  `process_vm_readv`/`process_vm_writev` syscalls this ADR's `_PROCESS_ISOLATION_SYSCALLS` denies —
  since those syscalls are denied but the file that does the same thing through `open`/`pread` isn't,
  when filesystem access is itself allowed. Not a regression (the same `filesystem=True` declaration
  already accepts unenforced filesystem access broadly) and host-dependent (blocked by
  `ptrace_scope=1`, the common Linux default, when the target is an ancestor process) — documented
  as a residual gap in what "denied unconditionally whenever any restriction is installed" (above)
  can actually deliver once `filesystem=True` is declared.
- Nine known CVEs in transitive dev/runtime dependencies (`anyio`, `httpx2`, `httpcore2`) were
  failing `pip-audit` — not introduced by this branch (`git diff main...HEAD -- uv.lock` before this
  fix touched only the two `pyseccomp` lines) but blocking this PR's own CI regardless, and `anyio`
  is runtime-reachable (`mcp`/`starlette` depend on it), unlike KI-062's/KI-087's dev-only exposure —
  filed and resolved as its own entry, **KI-103**, rather than folded silently into this ADR, since
  it's unrelated to plugin isolation itself.

**Deliberately not fixed in this pass, tracked as known limitations rather than silently left
inaccurate:**
- **No timeout anywhere on an isolated call.** A plugin that hangs blocks the calling host thread
  indefinitely — `_dispatch_loop`'s `recv_bytes()` call has no deadline (`run_isolated`'s own
  cleanup `finally` block does bound `process.join(timeout=5)`, but only runs after `_dispatch_loop`
  itself returns or raises, so it doesn't help while still blocked in `recv_bytes()`). Filed as
  **KI-102**. Pre-existing risk in a different shape (in-process execution also had no timeout), but
  the blocking-`recv_bytes()` shape is new.
- **A `RemoteWritable.write()` call is one full IPC round trip per call**, not batched — a plugin
  that writes in small increments (e.g. `json.dump`'s per-token writes) pays a real, measured
  latency cost proportional to call count, not just to spawn overhead. `isolate=False` is the
  immediate workaround for a write-heavy plugin; buffering `RemoteWritable`'s writes and flushing on
  a size threshold or at the end of the call would remove most of this without changing the
  boundary's safety properties, left as a future optimization.
- **The `filesystem=False` seccomp deny-list has no dedicated test confirming a full `run_isolated()`
  round trip still works under a live filter on Linux** — only the `network=False`/`network=True`
  cases are covered by `TestRealSeccompEnforcementOnLinux` (`tests/unit/test_plugin_sandbox.py`,
  Linux-only, skipped elsewhere). Since `filesystem=False` is the manifest default, this is the more
  consequential of the two untested directions; adding it is a natural next increment, not deferred
  for a design reason.

**Round-3 review — both CRITICAL fixes re-verified a third time (28 reproduction variants across
both, plus a real malicious plugin installed under a real entry point and invoked via
`run_isolated()`) — both still hold, no third bypass of the process boundary found. Round 2's own
fixes, however, were not the convergent pass the trend suggested: two of its six fixes each
introduced a new regression, one of them reachable through two shipped reference plugins. All fixed
here, four for real, two by an explicit design decision:**
- **HIGH — round-2 fix #2 (malformed-message handling) also caught a plugin's own legitimate
  exception when it happened to be one of the four wrapped types.** `_handle_one_message`'s FAILED
  branch raised the plugin's unwired exception *from inside* the same function round 2 wrapped in
  `except (ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError)` — and every `OntolithError` subclass aside,
  a plugin's own `ValueError`/`TypeError`/`KeyError`/`IndexError` all cross the boundary as
  themselves (they're on `RestrictedUnpickler`'s builtin-exception allowlist). Reproduced through two
  shipped reference plugins: `RdfExporter.export()` with no schema registered raises `ValueError`
  unsandboxed, but `PluginError: ...sent a malformed message... (ValueError: ...)` under
  `isolate=True` (the default); `JsonExporter.export(target=12345)` raises `TypeError` unsandboxed,
  same mislabelling under isolation. Both plugins document these exceptions in their own `Raises:`
  sections, so a caller's `except ValueError:`/`except TypeError:` silently stopped working the
  moment the plugin was sandboxed. Fixed: `_handle_one_message`'s FAILED branch now returns a
  `_Failed` wrapper instead of raising directly, and `_dispatch_loop` raises the wrapped exception
  *outside* the try/except that catches a malformed message's own shape — the two concerns (a
  plugin's own exception vs. a protocol violation) are now structurally distinct, not
  distinguished by exception type alone.
- **MEDIUM — the EOF handler's plain `process.join()` (no timeout) assumed EOF always means the
  process already exited.** `restricted_loads(b"")` raises `EOFError` too (pickle's own decoder, not
  the pipe closing) — a still-alive child that deliberately sends an empty message and then keeps
  running would hang the parent's `process.join()` forever, since `_dispatch_loop`'s own EOF branch
  never actually terminates the process, only waits for it. Fixed: every exceptional path in
  `_dispatch_loop` now goes through a new `_terminate_and_join` helper (`terminate()` then a bounded
  `join(timeout=5)`, `kill()` as a last resort) instead of an unbounded `join()` — reproduced with a
  child that sends `b""` then sleeps 30s: the parent now returns in well under 10s instead of hanging.
- **MEDIUM — round-2 fix #2's decode-error handling only caught `pickle.UnpicklingError`, not every
  way `restricted_loads` can fail on corrupt bytes.** A bogus pickle protocol byte raises a plain
  `ValueError`; a malformed string opcode raises `UnicodeDecodeError` (itself a `ValueError`
  subclass) — neither was caught by the narrower clause, so both escaped as raw exceptions, and
  (unlike the `UnpicklingError` branch) neither terminated the child. Reproduced with hand-crafted
  corrupt byte sequences for both. Fixed: the decode step's error handling is now `except EOFError`
  (specific, see above) followed by `except Exception` (broad — any other decode failure is treated
  as a protocol violation, same severity as an explicit `RestrictedUnpickler` refusal, and now
  actively terminates the child too).
- **MEDIUM — round-2 fix #3 (dict-key reduction in `to_wire_result`) broke every tuple-keyed dict.**
  Reducing a key through `to_wire_result` itself ran it through the same list/tuple branch a value
  would use, which always returns a `list` (JSON has no tuple type) — an unhashable result, so
  `to_wire_result({(1, 2): "v"})` raised a raw, undocumented `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`
  where it had previously (pre-round-2) worked, since a tuple of scalars is exactly as safe as a list
  of them for `restricted_loads`'s purposes. Fixed: keys go through a new, narrower
  `_reduce_dict_key` — scalars pass through, tuples recurse *as tuples*, anything else raises the
  documented `UnwirableArgumentError` instead of a raw `TypeError`.
- **LOW — `_PROCESS_ISOLATION_SYSCALLS` (the `ptrace`/`process_vm_*` denial) was skipped entirely
  for the single most-capable registration** (`network=True, filesystem=True`): the early-return "no
  restriction needed" branch ran before those syscalls were ever added to the deny list, so no filter
  was installed at all in that case. Fixed: the process-isolation syscalls are now unconditional,
  included even when neither `network` nor `filesystem` needs denying — they're a floor on what a
  plugin may reach *around* the boundary, not a consequence of what it's denied *through* it.
- **LOW (design decision, not a code fix) — the `ptrace_scope` rationale comment had the attack
  direction backwards.** It claimed `ptrace_scope=1` (a distro default on Ubuntu/Debian, not — as
  originally stated — a kernel-wide default) *permits* the child-to-parent attack this denial closes;
  YAMA's `ptrace_scope=1` actually confines a *tracer* to its own *descendants*, so it already
  *blocks* exactly this direction on hosts that have it — the denial defends the `ptrace_scope=0`
  hosts instead, where nothing else stops it. Corrected in place (`enforcement.py`'s own comment),
  not treated as an ADR self-Update, since it was never a design decision, only a wrong justification
  for a decision that itself was already correct.

Two round-2 items (the self-reported `ENFORCEMENT` message, `/proc/<ppid>/mem` under
`filesystem=True`) were re-examined and their reasoning confirmed sound; round 3 additionally found
the `ENFORCEMENT` fix's own "only the first message" cap could let a malicious child's forged
`applied=True` suppress a later *genuine* `applied=False` — narrowed to "only the first *genuine
`applied=False`* is honored," which closes that without reopening the log-flood round 2's own fix
was for (verified: a flood of 50 genuine `applied=False` messages still logs exactly once).

Round 3 also added a length cap to `recv_bytes()` (`protocol.py`'s `_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES`, 256 MiB) —
generous for any legitimate isolated-call payload this project ships today, small enough that one
oversized message from a malicious child can't grow the parent's memory unbounded before a single
byte of content is even inspected. This shipped in the same commit as the rest of round 3's fixes
but was missing from this record until round 4 pointed it out.

**Round-4 review — both CRITICALs re-reproduced a fourth time (21+ dispatch-escalation variants,
several hostile-`__reduce__` placements) after round 3's `_dispatch_loop` control-flow refactor —
both still hold, no new self-inflicted regression from that refactor. One MEDIUM found and fixed,
closing the last uncovered direction of the message-handling hardening rounds 2-3 built:**
- **MEDIUM — the *send* side of `_dispatch_loop` was never wrapped, only the *receive* side.**
  Rounds 2-3 hardened every path where the parent *reads* from the child (a malformed message, a
  decode failure, an EOF that might not mean the process exited) to surface as `PluginError` and
  actively reap the child. The three `protocol.send_*` calls in the same loop (the CALL allow-list
  refusal, the real method's success reply, the real method's own exception forwarded back) were
  never covered — if the child had already crashed or exited by the time the parent tried to reply,
  `send_result`/`send_error` raised a raw `BrokenPipeError` that propagated to the caller verbatim,
  contradicting `run_isolated`'s own documented contract ("`PluginError`: the child process ended
  without completing the call") and never actively reaping the child (`run_isolated`'s own `finally`
  still did, just up to 5s slower). Reproduced deterministically, including the fully non-adversarial
  case: a plugin makes an ordinary `kb.assertions()` call and then dies (segfault, `os._exit`,
  OOM-kill) before reading the reply. Fixed: `_dispatch_loop`'s wrapping `try`/`except` around
  `_handle_one_message` now also catches `OSError` (covers `BrokenPipeError`/
  `ConnectionResetError`) and `PluginError` (covers the "unknown protocol kind" branch
  `_handle_one_message` itself raises directly, a second, smaller gap round 4 found in the same
  sweep — it also skipped `_terminate_and_join`) — both now terminate the child and surface as
  `PluginError`, the same as every other protocol-level failure in this loop.
- Two doc-accuracy fixes from the same round: `_terminate_and_join`'s own docstring claimed it ran
  on "every exceptional path" when two didn't yet (the "unknown kind" branch and the send-side
  failures above, both now fixed to match); `registry.py`'s warning docstring claimed a declared-
  `True` capability is "never restricted, on any platform" — true for the *specific* capability
  declared `True`, but round 3's own `_PROCESS_ISOLATION_SYSCALLS` fix means a `network=True,
  filesystem=True` registration now gets a `ptrace`/`process_vm_*` denial regardless, an unrelated,
  always-on floor the original wording didn't anticipate — reworded to say so explicitly.

**Round-5 review — both CRITICALs re-reproduced a fifth time, every round 2-4 fix independently
re-verified (including the full gate suite, `--cov-fail-under=90` showing 95.35%) — no CRITICAL, no
HIGH, no MEDIUM, and no further code change requested. Ready to merge.** Only three LOW
documentation-staleness items found, all in paragraphs that summarize this ADR's own review history
elsewhere (`CHANGELOG.md`'s M4 entry and `docs/Ontolith_Implementation_Plan.md`'s status paragraph
and §8, all still saying "three review rounds" and, in one spot, an inconsistent shipped-date) —
fixed in the same commit as this record, no code touched.

## Follow-ups filed

- **macOS/Windows OS-level network/filesystem enforcement** — no KI filed as a *new* gap; this
  remains KI-014's own still-open half, now scoped precisely to non-Linux platforms rather than
  every platform.
- **Remote `QueryBuilder`/`AsOfView` proxy for isolated plugins** — filed as **KI-101**: an isolated
  plugin cannot call `kb.query(...)`/`kb.as_of(...)` today; no shipped reference plugin needs it yet,
  but a future `Reasoner`/`Connector` plugin doing anything beyond `assertions()`'s flat filter would.
- **No timeout on an isolated call** — filed as **KI-102** (round-2 review finding): a hung plugin
  blocks the calling host thread indefinitely; see this Update section's own "Deliberately not fixed"
  list above for the precise blocking call.
